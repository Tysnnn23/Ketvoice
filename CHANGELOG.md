## 🚀 2.3.1 — THE CLEAN PUBLIC BUILD

**Released:** 21 October 2026  
**Version:** `2.3.1` (`versionCode` 10)  
**Status:** ✅ Latest public release

This release is intentionally small in code and huge in safety. It removes the personal credentials that made the earlier APKs unsafe to share.

### 🔐 Security cleanup — before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **Spotify Canvas** | A personal Spotify `sp_dc` session cookie was compiled into the default settings. Anyone with the APK could extract it. | The default is empty. Each user enters their own cookie in **Settings → Spotify Canvas**. |
| **Private add-ons** | Private add-on URLs and tokens were compiled into `AppSettings`. | All default add-on endpoints are empty. Users add their own trusted sources in Settings or **Search → Sources**. |
| **Blank add-ons** | A blank add-on base could still start a malformed request before failing. | Blank endpoints are filtered out. Search and stream resolution return safely with no request. |
| **Public distribution** | The app could not be published safely with its embedded credentials. | The source and the 2.3.1 APK contain no session cookies, API tokens, or private add-on credentials. |
| **Versioning** | The last personal build was 2.3.0 (`versionCode` 9). | 2.3.1 (`versionCode` 10) is the first clean public build. |

### 🧪 Validation — before → after

| Check | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **JVM tests** | No public clean-build verification. | 36 tests across 6 suites, 0 failures. |
| **Android lint** | No public clean-build verification. | 0 errors. |
| **APK integrity** | Personal build only. | Debug-signed, zipaligned, APK Signature Scheme v2 verified. |

> ⚠️ Historical APKs from **1.2.0 through 2.3.0** are withheld because they embed development-only credentials. Version **2.3.1** is the first APK intended for public use.

## 🧩 2.3.0 — CUSTOM SOURCES, REAL YOUTUBE MUSIC, REAL CANVAS

**Released:** 21 October 2026  
**Version:** `2.3.0` (`versionCode` 9)  
**Status:** 🚫 Binary withheld — contained development credentials

### 🔎 Search and catalog — before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **Custom sources** | The app relied on built-in providers. There was no user-managed JSON source system. | Users can add HTTPS `.json` manifests, with direct endpoints or BitChord-compatible add-ons. |
| **Source validation** | A saved URL was not proven to work. | Ketvoice fetches the manifest and performs a real test search before saving it. |
| **Quality selection** | Quality was not negotiated from the source manifest. | The app reads declared quality options (`LOSSLESS`, `HIGH`, `LOW`, `high`, `normal`, `low`) and negotiates the best available tier. |
| **Downloads from sources** | There was no explicit source download endpoint. | An explicit `download` endpoint is preferred; otherwise the stream is used. `allowDownloads: 0` is respected. |
| **YouTube search** | Search could mix official tracks with less reliable results. | Search is restricted to official YouTube Music audio tracks with a real artist and album. |
| **Older results** | Previously cached or unverified entries could still play. | Old unverified entries are resolved again before playback. |
| **Artist search** | Artist results were only search rows. | Dedicated artist page with photo, description, monthly listeners, albums, and tracks. |
| **Album pages** | Albums were not resolved from real album IDs. | Album pages are built from real YouTube Music `MPRE...` identifiers. |
| **Home feed** | The home screen was generic. | A personalized YouTube Music home feed appears when a valid session is connected. |
| **Variants** | Slowed, sped-up, instrumental, type-beat, and re-upload variants could appear implicitly. | Those variants require an explicit search. |

### 🔐 YouTube Music session — before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **Account state** | A mock account system and fake “connected” state existed. | The account area reflects the real YouTube Music web session. No fake account is created. |
| **Login** | There was no real first-party login flow. | A WebView opens Google sign-in, with a manual `SAPISID` cookie fallback. |
| **Session storage** | No real session storage. | The cookie is stored locally with Android Keystore encryption. |
| **Validation** | “Connected” was cosmetic. | The app reports connected only after `account/account_menu` validates the session. |
| **History sync** | No real listening history submission. | A play is counted only when YouTube accepts the real tracking request. No fake history is created. |
| **Search history** | Assumed available. | Search history is not read back; only accepted playback events can be submitted. |
| **Personalized home** | Generic content. | Personalized home is available when the real session supports it. |

### 🎨 Canvas, accent, and settings — before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **Canvas** | No real Spotify Canvas pipeline. | Real Pathfinder lookup, Genius fallback, local video cache, and optional Wi-Fi-only downloads. |
| **Canvas credentials** | No user-controlled session. | The user provides a Spotify `sp_dc` cookie; no Spotify credential is bundled. |
| **Accent color** | Fixed accent color. | User-selectable accent applied to sliders, timeline, scrubber, controls, progress, downloads, switches, and selected states. |
| **Settings** | Some rows were visual or mock toggles. | Settings are persisted and functional. Choice rows open a sub-menu instead of changing on a single tap. |
| **Animated artwork** | The setting did not fully control Canvas downloads. | Turning off animated artwork also disables Canvas downloads. |
| **Lyrics settings** | Some lyric preferences were not persisted. | Inactive-lyric blur, animated artwork, and Canvas-on-mobile-data persist correctly. |
| **Cache** | Cache behavior was incomplete. | Real cache with a configurable ceiling up to 10 GB and real cache clearing. |

### 🖼️ Player, artwork, and lyrics — before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **Home logo** | A square background was visible around the logo. | The home logo is transparent and background-free. |
| **Artwork edge** | A visible border or hard edge appeared at the bottom of the artwork. | The artwork fades into the ambient background with no visible border. |
| **Artwork zoom** | Tapping could trigger zoom and open actions. | Zoom is removed. Tapping the artwork from lyrics returns to the artwork page without opening actions. |
| **Lyrics** | Typography was smaller and less legible. | 33 sp Black-weight lyrics with a wider layout. |
| **Lyric highlighting** | Timing could be approximated. | The highlight follows real source-provided segments only. Syllables and durations are never fabricated. |
| **Lyric controls** | Controls stayed visible. | Controls hide after 2 seconds; tapping the artwork brings them back. |
| **Translations** | Translation presentation was less integrated. | Translations appear as small subtitles under each original line. |
| **Swipe gesture** | Dismissal behavior was less direct. | A vertical swipe on the upper lyrics area returns to the mini-player. |
| **Mini-player** | Navigation and compact behavior were less polished. | Improved mini-player, navigation lens, three-dot indicator, and haptics. |

## 🎨 2.2.0 — OFFICIAL SEARCH, REAL LYRICS, CLEANER NAVIGATION

**Released:** 20 October 2026  
**Version:** `2.2.0` (`versionCode` 8)  
**Status:** 🚫 Binary withheld — contained development credentials

### 🔎 Search — before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **Official tracks** | Community uploads could be used as a fallback. | Search requires verified audio tracks with an artist and album. |
| **Old entries** | Unverified cached entries could play. | Entries are re-resolved before YouTube playback. |
| **Slowed/sped-up** | Variants could appear implicitly. | Explicit search is required. |

### ✍️ Lyrics — before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **Typography** | Smaller, lighter lyrics. | 33 sp Black weight, wider layout. |
| **Highlight timing** | Highlight could ignore real segment duration. | The glow progresses during each source-provided segment. |
| **Syllable timing** | Could imply fabricated syllable timing. | Syllable-by-syllable highlight only when the provider supplies it. |
| **Controls** | Always visible. | Hidden after 2 seconds without contact; artwork tap restores them. |
| **Translations** | Less clearly separated from the original line. | Small subtitle under each original line. |
| **Translation loading** | No progressive priority. | Priorities TTML translations, cached results, then loads near the active line first. |
| **Source labels** | Granularity was unclear. | French labels distinguish syllable, word, line, and unsynchronized text. |

### 🧭 Navigation and artwork — before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
|---|---|---|
| **Tabs** | Search could remain open behind a tab change. | Tabs close search and remain available in compact mode. |
| **Long press** | Navigation long-press behavior was basic. | Liquid Glass lens, drag, haptics, and a three-dot indicator. |
| **Zoom** | Artwork could zoom. | Zoom removed. |
| **Ambient background** | Flat or less adaptive. | Blurred, colored from the artwork, with brightness adaptation. |
| **Demo content** | Demo collections could appear in Explore and Library. | Fake collections removed. Real genres, albums, history, favorites, and downloads are used. |

**Released:** 20 October 2026

### Before → after

| Area | 😕 Before | ✅ After |
